# ruby-bubble-sort

This project was to create a bubble sort algorithm in ruby that takes an array and returns the array from lower number to higher number.

I used a loop that makes the swap variable false and them goes through every element of the array to check if the number next to it is higher or lower than it. If the number next to it is lower the loop then changes the placement of this 2 numbers and change the swap variable to true. At the end of the loop I have a unless conditional that stops the loop from ending if the swap variable is true which makes the loop continue as long as the array is not in the right order.
